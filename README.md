A banch of Web apps, written in javascript, html and css

This is a list of web apps created in javascript, html and css for my personal enjoyment.
Some of them were inspired by others (Coding Train of Shiffman, BoldChess.com, 101computing.net, Ten Minute Physics e.t.c) and some are created from scratch.
